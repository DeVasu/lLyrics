Help with translation is appreciated!

If you want to provide locales for your language, start like this:

1) 	Run "intltool-update -p -g messages".
	This will recreate the messages.pot file so that is up to date with the latest lLyrics source files.

2)	Run "msginit --locale=YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE".
	Replace YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE with your appropriate language short cut, e.g. "fr" for French or "ru" for Russian.
	This will create a new .po file with your language code.
	
Now you can translate all messages in the .po file into your language. The original string is given by "msgid", your translation should go to "msgstr".
